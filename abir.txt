Story or tragedy

docker-compose.yml been a pain in the ass. Been around two month and Eacces denied problem did
 not solved
Today Rifaet Ullah vai helped me but after a long session i got that problem was not solved ju
st avoided which i previously did so problem is still problem.

After that i just deleted the empty /node_modules local file. and the problem is gone.
It might be the empty /node_modules file contained a .cache file which we did not delete previously.
